  Rust Guide

#### A guide covering the Rust programming language including the applications and tools that will make you a better and more efficient Rust developer.

## Resources

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety. Rust has a comparable amount of runtime to C and C++, and has set up its standard library to be amenable towards OS development. Specifically, the standard library is split into two parts: core and std. Core is the lowest-level aspects only, and doesn't include things like allocation, threading, and other higher-level features.

## Tools

[Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) is a package manager that downloads your Rust projectâ€™s dependencies and compiles your project.

[Crater](https://crater.rust-lang.org/) is a tool to run experiments across parts of the Rust ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to detect regressions in the Rust compiler, and it does this by building a large number of crates, running their test suites and comparing the results between two versions of the Rust compiler. It can operate locally (with Docker as the only dependency) or distributed on the cloud. It can operate locally (with Docker as the only dependency) or distributed on the cloud.

[VSCde-Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/vscode-rust) is plugin that adds language support for Rust to Visual Studio Code. Rust support is powered by a separate language server - either by the official Rust Language Server (RLS) or rust-analyzer, depending on the user's preference. If you don't have it installed, the extension will install it for you (with permission). This extension is built and maintained by the Rust IDEs and editors team with the focus on providing a stable, high quality extension that makes the best use of the respective language server. 

[Clippy](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/) is a collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code.

[Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) is an interpreter for Rust's mid-level intermediate representation. It can run binaries and test suites of cargo projects and detect certain classes of undefined behavior. Miri will alsowill also tell you about memory leaks: when there is memory still allocated at the end of the execution, and that memory is not reachable from a global static, Miri will raise an error.

[Chalk](https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/) is an implementation and definition of the Rust trait system using a PROLOG-like logic solver.

[stdarch](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/arch/) is Rust's standard library vendor-specific APIs and run-time feature detection.

[Simpleinfra](https://github.com/rust-lang/simpleinfra) is rep that contains the tools and automation written by the Rust infrastructure team to manage our services. Using some of the tools in this repo require privileges only infra team members have.

[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) is a small set of exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code.

## Operating System

[Redox](https://www.redox-os.org) is a Unix-like Operating System written in Rust, aiming to bring the innovations of Rust to a modern microkernel and full set of applications. Acitvely being developed by [Jeremy Soeller](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/jackpot51).

[Tock](https://www.tockos.org) is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V based embedded platforms. Tock's design centers around protection, both from potentially malicious applications and from device drivers. Tock uses two mechanisms to protect different components of the operating system. First, the kernel and device drivers are written in Rust, a systems programming language that provides compile-time memory safety, type safety and strict aliasing. Tock uses Rust to protect the kernel (the scheduler and hardware abstraction layer) from platform specific device drivers as well as isolate device drivers from each other. Second, Tock uses memory protection units to isolate applications from each other and the kernel.

[Rust on Chrome OS](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/rust_on_cros.md) is a document that provides information on creating Rust projects for installation within Chrome OS and Chrome OS SDK. 

[Writing an OS in Rust ](https://os.phil-opp.com) is a blog series creates a small operating system in the Rust programming language by [Philipp Oppermann](https://github.com/phil-opp).
